# homebrew-fakegit

This repo is a Homebrew "tap" (package repository) for
[`github.com/ucarion/fakegit`](https://github.com/ucarion/fakegit). For more
information, see that repo.

This repo exists to show how you can make a Homebrew package with
[`github.com/ucarion/cli`](https://github.com/ucarion/cli) that automatically
installs your tool and its man pages, and gives the user instructions on how to
enable completion for Bash or ZSH.
